## About Me



Welcome to my page for the Distributed Research Apprenticeships for Master’s (DREAM) program! My name is Jan Carlos Ramos, and I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science with a focus on Machine Learning at the Georgia Institute of Technology, expecting to graduate in Summer 2025. My research interests include computer vision, deep learning, and leveraging these technologies to enhance everyday life.

In addition to my current studies, I completed a Master’s degree in Analytics, specializing in Computational Data Analytics, in Fall 2023 at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Prior to that, I graduated in Spring 2020 with a Bachelor’s degree in Statistics and Economics from the University of Florida.

I have several years of industry experience, primarily with Progressive Insurance, where I currently serve as a Senior Data Scientist. My previous roles there include Research and Development Analyst and Pricing Analyst. Throughout my industry experience, I developed a deep passion for computer science and statistics, which inspired my current educational pursuits. The OMSCS program has provided me with the opportunity to deepen my knowledge of computer science and engage in graduate-level research.



## About My Advisor


[Dr. Nicholas Lytle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-lytle-ph-d-a8374847) is the Associate Director of Research for OMSCS (Online Master of Science in Computer Science) at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Dr. Lytle earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from North Carolina State University, following his undergraduate studies at the University of Virginia, where he earned a B.S. in Computer Science. With a focus on computing education, Dr. Lytle has conducted research in the Game2Learn Lab under Dr. Tiffany Barnes at North Carolina State University, exploring the effective design of computational thinking activities within core K-12 courses. His passion lies in developing adaptive technologies to aid students in learning programming and computational thinking, aiming to empower teachers to effectively introduce these concepts into their classrooms. His academic journey reflects a commitment to improving computing education for all through innovative and engaging approaches.

## About My Project

There are a set of topics that students will learn about in an introductory computer science course. When trying to learn the material, the first video isn't always the best. One video can be hours long with little to no timestamps for easy and purposeful skimming. This research falls in the realm of neural topic modeling, which is a deep learning technique used to discover and extract topics from large unstructured data. The key idea behind my research is to decompose a computer science course into the knowledge components needed for competency. These knowledge components are then used as the topic timestamps for the course's video lecture content. Formally, this is a classification problem in which I'll use pre-labeled video lecture content to train a topic segmentation model that fuses multimodal feature embeddings to carefully assign knowledge components as timestamps to the video lectures. The video lecture content I will be using is from Georgia Tech's online CS1301 - Intro to Computing course, taught by Dr. David Joyner. The aim of this framework is to build an unsupervised learning pipeline that can process educational video content and assign topic segments that students can easily refer to. The broader aim is to integrate this video processing pipeline into an educational content recommendation engine based on student performance weaknesses.
