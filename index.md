## About Me



Welcome to my page for the Distributed Research Apprenticeships for Master’s (DREAM) program! My name is Jan Carlos Ramos, and I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science with a focus on Machine Learning at the Georgia Institute of Technology, expecting to graduate in Summer 2025. My research interests include computer vision, deep learning, and leveraging these technologies to enhance everyday life.

In addition to my current studies, I completed a Master’s degree in Analytics, specializing in Computational Data Analytics, in Fall 2023. Prior to that, I graduated in Spring 2020 with a Bachelor’s degree in Statistics and Economics from the University of Florida.

I have several years of industry experience, primarily with Progressive Insurance, where I currently serve as a Senior Data Scientist. My previous roles there include Research and Development Analyst and Pricing Analyst. Throughout my industry experience, I developed a deep passion for computer science and statistics, which inspired my current educational pursuits. The OMSCS program has provided me with the opportunity to deepen my knowledge of computer science and engage in graduate-level research.
