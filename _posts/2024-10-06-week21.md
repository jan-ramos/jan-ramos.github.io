Came back this week and met with Dr. Lytle to catch back up to speed. He recommended that I work on an IRB submission to conduct the usability study of my EdTech application. This week I researched the required documentation needed to successfully submit a proposal to our Institutional Review Board (IRB):

The required documentation include:
1. Volunteer Consent Form
2. Moderation Guide
3. Volunteer Announcement Form
4. Intake Form
