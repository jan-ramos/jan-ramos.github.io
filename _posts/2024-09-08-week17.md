This week I finished the Streamlit application with the following UI structure:

1. Search bar:
    Support question types from user that are converted into embeddings.
2. Video Display:
    Once submitted the interface displays the most relevant video in the center display and begins playback.
3. Coding Example:
    Directly below the video, the interface presents a Python coding example related to the studentâ€™s question. This is created using our language model.
4. RAG Summarization and Textbook reference:
    Implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) process that summarizes the highest-ranked embeddings from the database. Beneath the code example, the application highlights the most relevant textbook section.
