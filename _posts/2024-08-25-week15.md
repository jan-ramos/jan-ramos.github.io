This week I continued progress on the following:
- Begin embedding generation pipeline
- Test initial vector storage methods
- Develop retrieval mechanisms
- Create evaluation metrics for system performance

Vector Database Architecture Design:
- Primary Components:
  * Text Processing Pipeline
    - Whisper transcription integration
    - MPNet embedding generation (768d)
    - Temporal chunking system
  * Visual Processing Pipeline
    - Frame extraction module
    - CLIP embedding generation (512d)
    - Visual feature aggregation
  * Storage Organization
    - Dual index structure (text/visual)
    - Metadata schema design
    - Cross-modal linking strategy

Implementation Progress:
- Completed initial Pinecone setup
  * Created development environment
  * Configured serverless infrastructure
  * Established connection protocols
  * Set up monitoring systems

Pipeline Development:
- Audio Processing
  * Implemented Whisper base model
  * Created batch processing system
  * Added timestamp preservation
  * Developed error handling

- Video Processing
  * Built frame extraction system
  * Implemented CLIP integration
  * Created temporal alignment logic
  * Added quality checks
