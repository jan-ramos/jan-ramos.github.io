I had my kick-off meeting with Dr. Nicholas Lytle. During the meeting, we discussed the intial scope and time-frame for the project. We're anticipating 20 hours of work with an anticipated completion date of early-October. 

Amongst the various topics, we settled on a multimodal topic segmentation model that leverages GaTech's Introduction to Python 1301 MOOC course. Our project lies at the intersection of deep learning and computational education, with a focus on student learning. We aim to develop a process for identifying, classifying, and catering multi-modal educational content to student needs.
