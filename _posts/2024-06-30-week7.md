From Week 7-9 I will be traveling outside of the country. These few weeks I will be focusing on dataset labeling now that I have extracted the audio transcripts.

Meeting #10: Dr. Lytle
    - We reviewed the final dataset labeling drafts and came to a concensus. Incorporating both a topic segmentation and classification approach in our dataset labeling. 
    - I will be labeling the rest of the video dataset during my travels in addition to conducting further paper reviews.
