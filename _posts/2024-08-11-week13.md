1. What does the paper talk about?
    - Presents research on multi-modal video search by examples (MVSE) focusing on:
        1. Impact of video quality on search performance
        2. Novel multi-modal retrieval framework
        3. Two-stage retrieval mechanism
        4. Weight-based ranking algorithms

    - Key methodology:
        1. Uses state-of-the-art techniques for face recognition and speaker recognition
        2. Implements two-stage retrieval combining hashing and cosine similarity
        3. Evaluates system on both high-quality and low-quality BBC archive videos
        4. Tests various fusion algorithms for combining multi-modal search results

    - Results show:
        - Multi-modal search outperforms single-modal approaches
        - Face recognition more robust to quality degradation than speaker recognition
        - Two-stage retrieval provides good balance of speed and accuracy
        - Combined queries achieve higher precision than single modality

2. How/What can I use from this paper?
    The biggest take away from this paper was the use of Multi-modal fusion strategies. This is something I want to incorporate for our visual querying.


This paper finalizes my literature review. It seems evident that the best approach moving forward is the vector database approach.

Meeting #12: Dr. Lytle 
  - Reviewed scope of new approach with Dr. Lytle. He recommended additional video repositiories to get educational content from.
