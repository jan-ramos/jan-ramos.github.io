title: Week 10
---

Returned from trip this week. Minimal progress done on project to account for jet lag. Did finalize pattern for asset processing. For audio and visual processing I will use the following pattern:
- The raw mp4 video file is downloaded using yt-dlp.
- The text transcription with timestamps is generated using OpenAI Whisper.
- The text transcription is divided into manageable chunks.
- Each chunk is then passed through a text embedding model to produce its dense vector representation.
- Concurrently, one frame from each chunk will be passed through a visual embedding model to generate a vector representation of the visual context.

Meeting #11: Dr. Lytle 
  - We reviewed dataset labeling and asset processing pattern. I mentioned the possibility of transitioning project scope to leverage vector databases and semantic search for content retrieval. Will be conducting literature review over the next couple of weeks to understand viability.
