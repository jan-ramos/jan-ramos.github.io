This week I worked on the initial vector database design. I have decided to use Pinecone as the cloud storage platform for the database.

Initial Vector Database Design:
- Dual embedding approach:
  * Text embeddings for transcripts and metadata
  * Visual embeddings for frame content and slides

Content Organization Strategy:
- Segment-level embeddings:
  * 768-dimensional text vectors (MPNet)
  * 512-dimensional visual vectors (CLIP)
  * Combined multimodal representations

 Example video pipeline:
1. The raw mp4 video file is downloaded with the source platform and assigned a unique video ID.
2. The text transcription with timestamps is generated by processing the video's audio content.
3. The text transcription is divided into manageable chunks.
4. Each chunk is then passed through a text embedding model to produce its dense vector representation.
5. Concurrently, one frame from each chunk will be passed through a visual embedding model to generate a vector representation of the visual context.
6. Finally, these embeddings are uploaded into a vector database, creating a searchable repository that supports multi-modal queries.
