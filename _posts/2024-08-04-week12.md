This week I did one paper review while managing ongoing course-load.

Paper Review #10:

1. What does the paper talk about?
    - The paper presents an enhanced approach to textbook question answering (TQA) using:
        1. Large Language Models (specifically Llama-2) for core comprehension
        2. Retrieval Augmented Generation for context handling
    - Addresses key challenges in TQA:
        * "Out-of-domain" scenarios where concepts span multiple lessons
        * Long context handling in educational content
        * Complex reasoning requirements
    - Methodology:
        1. Fine-tuning Llama-2 on CK12-QA dataset with supervised approach
        2. Implementing RAG for context enhancement
        3. Using PEFT/LORA for efficient fine-tuning
        4. Applying quantization for computational efficiency

2. How/What can I use from this paper?
    - The RAG implementation will be a useful guide for integrating with my application.
