This week I met with the GaTech Edx team. This team has been using the internal 1301 Intro to Computing clickstream data to conduct research in the area of computing education. 


This week I also started my weekly recurring meetings with Dr. Lytle. During our first recurring meeting we discussed various sources to start the initial research and related works section of my project. Since a central component of this neural topic segmentation model is the dataset labeling, Dr. Lytle suggested looking at the ACM and IEEE guidelines for what is taught in a CS degree. Additionally, I took a look at the Advanced Placement Computer Science A (APCSA) curriculum to see the expectations for an introductory computer science course. These sources serve as the baseline for initial dataset labeling and eventual model segmentation. He also recommended I read a paper on the expectations of introductory CS curriculum which I expand upon in Paper Review #1.
